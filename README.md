# A-Generic-Analysis-on-the-Impact-Ratio-of-Social-Media-Al-on-the-Youth
Social Media and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become integral parts of youth life, influencing mental health, learning behavior, productivity, and social interactions. While AI technologies such as mental-health detection models, chatbots, and recommendation systems offer benefits like early issue identification and personalized assistance, they also introduce risks related to bias, lack of empathy, misinformation, and unsafe content. Similarly, algorithm-driven social-media platforms shape user behavior through engagement loops, peer pressure, and content amplification, often impacting emotional well-being.

This project presents a research-based comparative analysis of the combined impact of Social Media and AI on youth by studying four significant research papers. The project extracts key data such as objectives, datasets, methodologies, models, accuracy metrics, and limitations, and compares them using a unified impact-ratio framework. The findings highlight both positive and negative influences and emphasize the need for a balanced, hybrid counseling approach that integrates AI tools with human guidance.

The repository contains documentation, UML diagrams, data flow representations, literature survey, system architecture, and analysis summaries to support academic evaluation and future extensions.
